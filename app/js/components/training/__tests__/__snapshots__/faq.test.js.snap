        Each lecture is $60 /hr. with a two hour minimum per session. Usually we'll meet twice a week for two hours, but once per week is fine if you are in less of a hurry or have a busy schedule.

        The amount of time we'll need to complete these goals is an approximation and can vary pretty substantially from person to person. The actual time will depend on your existing background, the pace you're comfortable with, unique interests and the amount of time you're able to invest in doing homework. Keep in mind that while some of the options listed above might be nice, they aren't required and you could always choose to explore them on your own (possibly with a certain amount of help) if you need to keep the costs down. Also practicing a lot will make a big difference.

        Training is held online via web conferencing software. If you're thinking, "I'm traditional" and feel concerned about working remotely, I suggest at least giving it a try. With the screen sharing and code pairing software we'll use, I believe you'll quickly feel at home with it and in many ways find it more effective. If you'd really rather meet in person, if we're local I can sometimes make exceptions although the cost will include a travel fee.

      Homework

        As mentioned already, web development is a complex field and requires a lot of time to master. Realistically there is way more critical material to learn than we can possibly cover in the short time we have for our meetings. So in addition to the lectures, there will be substantial homework. Some of it will directly relate to what we are doing and some will be supplementary reading or online training material that I have compiled. Trust me that it would be impossible to learn this trade simply by listening to someone else coach you. There is no shortcut around hard work and discipline!

        Code bootcamps like this have a three pronged approach. First are the lectures themselves, second is the benefit of having a mentor to curate and guide you along, and last but not least is to get you coding and building a lot of stuff. This is the same proven formula that the much costlier bootcamps like Hackreactor use. So roll up your sleeves and get ready!

        Forget about road blocks. If you're having an issue between lessons, you are encouraged to shoot me an email or set up a brief online session if needed. Up to 30 minutes of office time per week is available for as long as we are working together.

      Cancellation policy

      <p>
        Important events and emergencies come up for everyone, but please provide as much notice as possible if you need to make a change.Â  As a private teacher rescheduling/canceling, especially at the last minute, make it difficult to maintain a full schedule. So it's very important that you make a firm commitment when scheduling. If you must cancel/reschedule within 5 days of our appointment, you may be billed a 50% late change fee.
         
        <strong>
          Any and all non-emergency changes made with 24 hours of our appointment are subject to full charge.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you tend to have a lot of schedule changes to the point that you think you'll have a difficult time keeping regular appointments, I would prefer that we hold off until you are able to maintain a predictable schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        I appreciate your understanding.
